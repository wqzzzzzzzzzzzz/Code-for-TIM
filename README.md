Title of the paper: "Linear and Widely Linear Recursive Maximum Complex-Domain Loglikelihood AdaptiveÂ Filtering in Intricate Measurement Environments".

The numerical simulation code from the paper includes simulations in intricate environment 1, intricate environment 2, DOA tracking, and channel equalization. These are respectively named Linear_environment 1, Linear_environment 2, Widely_linear_environment 1, Widely_linear_environment 2, DOA_Tracking, and Channel_Euqalization. 
The repository also includes the experimental code used to facilitate comprehension of concepts presented in other papers, serving as a valuable reference.
For all experimental parameter settings, please refer to the original text. 
The runtime environment is Matlab2024a.
